# Hello, I'm Jin!

I am a graduate from Nanyang Technological University with a profound interest in cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

## Projects
**Home Detection Lab**<br>

</p>
<p>In this mini project, I designed and built a home lab network from the ground up, incorporating various enterprise-grade technologies. At the core of the network, I deployed Windows Server 2022 as an Active Directory (AD) domain controller, enabling centralized authentication, resource management, and policy enforcement.<br>

To simulate a real-world IT environment, I provisioned multiple workstation types, including Windows 11 Enterprise and Ubuntu Desktop 22.04, each configured to join the active directory with winbind and interact with network resources.<br>

I also set up an email server on Ubuntu, which allowed my workstations to send, receive, store, and manage emails internally. This email infrastructure will also play a key role in later phases of the project, where I will simulate phishing attacks and analyze email security controls.<br>

To enhance the projectâ€™s security testing component, I deployed Kali Linux as a dedicated attacker machine, which will be used for penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and phishing simulations.<br>

Ultimately, through this project, I gained hands-on experience in network administration, security operations, and working with SIEM tools, allowing me to better understand how the network works with each other.</p>
